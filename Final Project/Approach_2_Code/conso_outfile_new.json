        "Text": "Participation in other interventional research.\nHistory of penetrating head injury\nHistory of TBI more severe than mild by DVBIC criteria\nDiagnosis of a primary or secondary HA disorder other than PTHA\nLifetime history of 5 or more migraine or probable migraine headaches pre-dating mTBI\nHAs of any kind of moderate or severe intensity on an average of more than 2 days per month preceding the concussive trauma\nContinuous HAs of any kind (i.e., persistent daily HAs with no HA-free period less than 8 hours between attacks)\nAcute or serious medical illness or unstable chronic medical illness (e.g., unstable angina, myocardial infarction within 6 months, congestive heart failure, clinically significant or concerning cardiac arrhythmias; preexisting hypotension [systolic blood pressure<110] or orthostatic hypotension [systolic drop >20 mm Hg after 2 min standing accompanied by lightheadedness], chronic renal or hepatic failure, acute pancreatitis, Meniere's disease, or diagnosed but untreated sleep apnea). The eligibility of potential participants having acute serious and/or chronic medical illnesses other than those listed will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis by a study physician, PA-C, or ARNP.\nUse of prazosin or other alpha-1 antagonist (including but not limited to alfuzosin, doxazosin, silodosin, tamsulosin, terazosin) for any purpose in the 2 weeks prior to initial screen (P1) visit and prohibited throughout the study\nAllergy or previous adverse reaction to prazosin or other alpha-1 antagonist\nActive psychosis or psychotic disorder, severe depression (as determined per clinician prescriber judgment), severe psychiatric instability or severe situational life crisis (including evidence of being actively suicidal or homicidal).\nMeets Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th Edition (DSM-5) criteria for any Substance Use Disorder except caffeine-related disorders, or tobacco-related disorders.\nHistory of delirium within the prior 3 months, epilepsy, stroke, dementia, psychotic disorder, or bipolar disorder\nStructural brain abnormalities on any prior imaging with associated clinically evident manifestations\nCurrent participation in transcranial magnetic stimulation studies\nWomen of childbearing potential must not be pregnant, planning to become pregnant during the study period, or nursing.\nParticipation in a HA support group or other activity such as meditation or yoga intended to mitigate HA or other chronic pain must be stable at least 4 weeks prior to beginning the initial screen (P1) visit and may not be started during the study\nFailure to record HA data for at least 80% of days during the Screening Period\nNot suitable for study per clinician judgement.\nThe use of HA rescue or symptom-relieving medications will be allowed during the study. This includes triptans, ergotamines, opioids, simple analgesics (e.g. acetaminophen, aspirin, or non-steroidal anti-inflammatories [NSAIDS], and combination analgesics. Their use will be recorded on the concurrent medication CRF during the Preliminary Screening Period (P1) and throughout the remainder of the study. Randomization of participants will be stratified based on whether their use of HA medications meets ICHD-3 beta criteria for overuse of these medications, as described in section 5.5 below.\nOpioid Medications: Use of opioids for treatment of HA or non-HA-related pain or for any other purpose is allowed during the study. Any opioid use would ideally be excluded due to potential confounding effects on interpretation of response to treatment. However, in this population, particularly in Veterans with chronic pain or undergoing minor orthopedic or dental procedures, opioid use is common. Use of opioids, including frequency and dose, will be recorded on the concurrent medication CRF.\nOther Medications: Participants who are taking other medications on a routine basis must be on a stable dose for at least 4 weeks prior to the Preliminary Screening Period (P1), and must intend to continue the medication at the same regimen for the duration of the trial unless lack of efficacy, safety, or tolerability dictates otherwise. The following medications are not excluded:\nPsychoactive drugs (for example, anticonvulsants, benzodiazepines, antidepressants, sedative/hypnotics),\nAntihypertensive medications (including beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme [ACE] inhibitors, and angiotensin receptor blockers),\nThe use of magnesium in any dose that is prescribed for the purpose of HA prevention or treatment must be stable for at least 4 weeks. The incidental use of magnesium in multi-vitamins, laxatives, etc. is permissible but must be documented.\nHormones (for example, testosterone, estrogen, or progesterone) in any form.\nThe \"as-needed\" (prn) use of psychoactive and other drugs such as antibiotics is not excluded; however, such use must be discussed with a clinician prescriber and documented.\nThe use of butalbital in any form within 4 weeks of beginning the Preliminary Screening Period (P1) through the end of the participant's study involvement is exclusionary.\nParticipants who have been taking trazodone will undergo a 2-week washout period before the Preliminary Screening Period (P1 visit). Combining prazosin and trazodone may increase the risk of priapism. We have decided to begin the washout period before the Preliminary Screening Period in order to remove any confounding variables while on the headache log and actigraphy.\nSildenafil (Viagra), tadalafil (Cialis), vardenafil (Levitra), and avanafil (Stendra) will not be permitted during the study drug dose Titration Period, because of increased risk of hypotension in combination with alpha-1 blockers, but will be allowed at half the usual starting dose following the study drug dose Titration Period, per VA prescribing guidelines.\nUse of supplements containing nitrates and supplements containing stimulants (such as ephedra) are exclusionary in the two weeks prior to initial screen (P1) visit and prohibited throughout the study. Participants who take these supplements will be asked to discontinue them for a minimum of two weeks before the Preliminary Screening Period (P1 visit)..\nUse of prescribed stimulants (such as amphetamine or dextroamphetamine containing medications) is exclusionary in the 2 weeks prior to the initial screen (P1) visit and prohibited throughout the study. Participants who take these medications will be asked to discontinue them for a minimum of 2 weeks before the Preliminary Screening Period.\n",

Patients who have received prior adjuvant therapy for early-stage lung cancer are eligible if at least 12 months have elapsed from that treatment. \n3. Histologically confirmed squamous cell bronchogenic carcinoma. Patients whose tumors contain mixed non-small cell histologies are eligible, as long as squamous carcinoma is the predominant histology. Mixed tumors with small cell anaplastic elements are not eligible. Cytologic specimens obtained by brushings, washings, or needle aspiration of the defined lesion are acceptable. \n4. Patients with previous radiotherapy as definitive therapy for locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer are eligible, as long as the recurrence is outside the original radiation therapy port. Radiation therapy must have been completed >4 weeks prior to the initiation of study treatment. Patients who have received chemo/radiation for locally advanced NSCLC are not eligible. Patients who have received palliative radiation therapy for symptomatic metastases must have completed treatment >14 days prior the initiation of the study treatment. \n5. Presence of evaluable (measureable or non-measurable) disease. \n6. ECOG Performance Status of 0 or 1. \n7. Laboratory values as follows: \nAbsolute neutrophil count (ANC) >1,500/microL and platelets >100,000/microL (\u226472 hours prior to initial treatment). \nHemoglobin >9 g/dL (Note: Patients may be transfused or receive erythropoietin to maintain or exceed this level). \nBilirubin < ULN. \nAlanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) \u22642.5 times the upper limit of normal if no liver involvement or \u22645 times the upper limit of normal with liver involvement. \nCreatinine <2.0 mg/dL, or creatinine clearance >40 mL/min (as calculated by the Cockcroft-Gault method. \n8. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test performed within 7 days prior to start of treatment. Women of childbearing potential or men with partners of childbearing potential must use effective birth control measures during treatment and at least 6 months after the last dose of the study treatment. If a woman becomes pregnant or suspects she is pregnant while participating in this study, she must agree to inform her treating physician immediately. Sexually active men must agree to use a medically acceptable form of birth control during treatment and at least 6 months after the last dose.

Potentially Fertile Women include any woman who has experienced menarche and who has not undergone successful surgical sterilization (hysterectomy, bilateral tubal ligation or bilateral oophorectomy) or who is not post-menopausal (defined as amenorrhea = 12 consecutive months, or women who are receiving hormone replacement therapy with a documented level of follicle stimulating hormone (FSH)> 35 mlU / ml). Potentially fertile women must have a pregnancy test with a negative result in the 72 hours prior to the start of the trial.\nSexually active males (including vasectomized males) who are being treated with MMF must accept the use of barrier contraceptive methods during MMF treatment and for 90 days thereafter. Potentially fertile partners of these patients should use a reliable contraceptive method during the same period, in order to minimize the risk of pregnancy.\nPatients must agree not to donate blood during treatment with MMF and during the 6 subsequent weeks. Males should not make a sperm donation during MMF treatment and up to 90 days after completion.\n",

        "Text": "1. Personal history of stroke, brain lesions, previous neurosurgery, any personal history of seizure or fainting episode of unknown cause, or head trauma resulting in loss of consciousness, lasting over 30 minutes or with sequela lasting longer than two days. \nJustification: Stroke or head trauma can lower the seizure threshold, and are therefore contra-indications for TMS. Fainting episodes or syncope of unknown cause could indicate an undiagnosed condition associated with seizures. \nScreening tool: TMS adult safety questionnaire, Medical History. \n2. First-degree family history of any neurological disorder with a potentially hereditary basis, including migraines, epilepsy, or multiple sclerosis. \n1. Justification: Neurological disorders can lower the seizure threshold, and are therefore contra-indications for TMS. First-degree family history of certain neurological disorders with a hereditary component increases the risk of the subject having an undiagnosed condition that is associated with lowered seizure threshold. \n2. Screening tool: TMS adult safety screening, Medical History. \n3. Cardiac pacemakers, neural stimulators, implantable defibrillator, implanted medication pumps, intracardiac lines, or acute, unstable cardiac disease, with intracranial implants (e.g. aneurysm clips, shunts, stimulators, cochlear implants, or electrodes) or any other metal object within or near the head that precludes MRI scanning. \n1. Justification: Any metal around the head is a contraindication for both MRI and TMS, as both methods involve exposure to a relatively strong magnetic field. \n2. Screening tool: TMS adult safety screening, MRI safety screening, Medical History. \n4. Noise-induced hearing loss or tinnitus. \n1. Justification: individuals with noise-induced hearing problems may be particularly vulnerable to the acoustic noise generated by TMS and MRI equipment. \n2. Screening tools: TMS adult safety screening. \n5. Current use (any use in the past 4 weeks, chronic use within 6 past six months) of any investigational drug or of any medications with psychotropic, anti or pro-convulsive action. \n1. Justification: The use of certain medications or drugs can lower seizure threshold and is therefore contra-indicated for TMS. \n2. Screening tools: MRI safety screening questionnaire, Medical history, Medical Assessments: Urine toxicology analyzes for presence of a broad range of prescription and nonprescription drugs. \n6. Lifetime history of major depressive disorder, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, mania, or hypomania. \n1. Justification: The population of interest here is a healthy control population with no psychiatric disorders. In subjects with depression, bipolar disorder, mania or hypomania, there is a small chance that TMS can trigger (hypo)manic symptoms. \n2. Screening tools: SCID Screen Patient Questionnaire. Potential diagnoses will be further evaluated by a counsellor. \n7. Meet current DSM V criteria for moderate to severe substance use disorder (excluding nicotine), smoke daily, or urine toxicology positive for any illicit substance inconsistent with history given. \n1. Justification: The population of interest here is a healthy control population with no substance use disorder. Current use of illicit substances could impact on seizure threshold and is therefore contra-indicated for TMS. \n2. Screening tools: SCID Screen Patient Questionnaire. Potential diagnoses will be further evaluated by a counsellor, Drug Use Survey (DUS), Substance Use Disorder Evaluation, Medical Assessments: urine qualitative drug screen is performed for methadone, benzodiazepines, cocaine, amphetamine/methamphetamine, opiates, barbiturates, and tetrahydrocannabinol. \n8. Have met DSM V criteria for moderate to severe substance use disorder (excluding nicotine, alcohol and cannabis) in the past, or have met DSM V criteria for moderate to severe substance use disorder for cannabis or alcohol in the past 5 years. \n1. Justification: the population of interest here is a healthy control population with no present or past substance use disorder. \n2. Screening tools: SCID Screen Patient Questionnaire. Potential diagnoses will be further evaluated by a counselor. Drug Use Survey (DUS), Substance Use Disorder Evaluation. \n9. History of myocardial infarction, angina, congestive heart failure, cardiomyopathy, stroke or transient ischemic attack, or any heart condition currently under medical care. \n1. Justifications: the risk of TMS for individuals with a heart condition is unknown. \n2. Screening tool: physical assessment (EKG), medical history. \n10. Pregnant women or women with reproductive potential who are sexually active and not using an acceptable form of contraception. \n1. Justification: it is unknown whether TMS poses a risk to fetuses. \n2. Screening tool: Medical assessments (urine pregnancy test) at the beginning of each visit that involves TMS or MRI. \n11. History of learning disability or current ADHD \n1. Justification: Subjects should be able to perform cognitive tasks to a high degree of accuracy, both in the MRI scanner and outside the scanner. Subjects with ADHD/LD may engage different neural circuitry even if they can perform the tasks. \n2. Screening tool: Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence, Medical history, Adult ADHD Self-Report Scale. \n12. Participation in an rTMS session less than two weeks ago. \n1. Justification: in order to limit exposure to TMS, we will not enroll subjects who have received TMS less than two weeks ago. \n2. Screening tool: TMS safety screening questionnaire.       \n    \n"

Justification: Many neural processes change with age, and these changes could introduce unwanted variability in both behavioral and MRI signals. In addition, the risk of difficult-to-detect medical abnormalities such as silent cerebral infarcts increases with age. \n2. Screening tool: History. Government-issued forms of identification (e.g. driver s license, birth certificate) will be required when participant appears to be out of age range. \n3. Be in good health. \n1. Justification: Many illnesses may alter neural functioning as well as fMRI signals. \n2. Screening tools: Medical Assessment, Medical History and Physical Examination. Medical assessments include: Vital Signs, EKG, oral HIV test, height/weight measurements, urinalysis and blood sample. Tests on the blood sample include CBC, complete metabolic profile, TSH, ESR, STS and HIV (if needed to confirm a positive salivary test for HIV). The following individual laboratory results will independently disqualify individuals: Cholesterol >250 mg/dl, Hemoglobin < 10.5 g/dl, WBC < 2400/microl, LFTs > 3Xnormal, HCG positive, Casual serum glucose > 200 mg/dl, Urine protein > 1+. The MAI will retain discretion to exclude at less extreme values, depending on the clinical presentation. (Serum glucose over 140 mg/dl will be followed up with a fasting serum glucose assessment. Those with fasting glucose below 100 mg/dl may be considered for the protocol. Others will be rejected and referred for work-up.) MAI will make the final judgment on any questionable lab results. \n4. Right-handed. \n1. Justification: Using right-handed individuals will reduce variability in BOLD MRI data. \n2. Screening tool: Edinburgh Handedness Inventory. \n5. Estimated IQ greater than or equal to 85 \n1. Justification: Subjects must be able to perform a cognitively challenging task to a high standard. \n2. Screening tool: Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence. \n"

Patients with a lesion suspicious of hepatic malignancy on a screening imaging study will only be eligible if the likelihood of carcinoma is <=10% following an appropriate evaluation.\nHistory of having received any systemic anti-neoplastic (including radiation) or immunomodulatory treatment (including systemic corticosteroids) <=6 months prior to the first dose of study drug or the expectation that such treatment will be needed at any time during the study.\nMajor organ transplantation.\nThyroid disease with thyroid function poorly controlled on prescribed medications. Patients with abnormal thyroid stimulating hormone or T4 concentrations, with elevation of antibodies to thyroid peroxidase and any clinical manifestations of thyroid disease are excluded.\nHistory or other evidence of severe retinopathy (e.g. CMV retinitis, macula degeneration) or clinically relevant ophthalmological disorder due to diabetes mellitus or hypertension\nInability or unwillingness to provide informed consent or abide by the requirements of the study.\nHistory or other evidence of severe illness or any other conditions which would make the patient, in the opinion of the investigator, unsuitable for the study.\nPatients with a value of alpha-fetoprotein >100 ng/mL are excluded, unless stability (less than 10% increase) has been documented over at least the previous 3 months.\nEvidence of drug and/or alcohol abuse (20g/day for women & 30g/day for men).\nPatients included in another trial or having been given investigational drugs within 12 weeks prior to screening\nAny known history of hypersensitivity to interferon.\n",
